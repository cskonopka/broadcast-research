absorbed into The Psychedelic Dementia
cities of Bacteria On Finger Tips
imprisoned Fly
smog Monster
black pill Sun Bursts
daily stasis Dreamcatcher
losing the line in the rain Interlaced Gaslights
smushed liquid metal Between The Cushions
traveling along simple lines No One Cares A Bout
applying nail polish Veiling Toiled Mendacity
blood and data The Same
mole Making Subways
spacey Nodes Unbeknownst
the tornado in my mind Holding Strict Guidlines To Redirect Debris
cerulean Cantaloupe
diurnal Chicanery
emvedded sycophant Lacing Your Saliva With Acrimony
firing Chamber
hammerhead sharks Sniffing Blood Trails
sipping Puma
the fangs Transpire During Nightfall
