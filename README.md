The *broadcast-research* a data art project that explores the potential using my analog video synthesis catalog as a generative feedback tool for creating artistic works. Written in Go, the project seeks to use data-mining, machine learning and NLP to gain new insights about the catalog and learn about interlaced subconscious psychological trends. 

A detailed overview of the project can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/cskonopka/broadcast-research/wiki).

## Who am I?
My name is Christopher Konopka and I'm a video artist with a focus on modular analog video synthesizers. When I started in 2015, I made the decision to record video content each time I sat down to experiment and whenever I performed. Video art has been and is a significant trend in my life when it comes to interpersonal relationships and personal development. It has provided an outlet that helps me encapsulate intense emotions that can derail my focus and allows me to compartimentalize the event, helping me manage anxiety and depression. Each piece is a journal entry with a unique title and a visual abstraction of the mindset with no audio. The reason for no audio is because I want the viewer to experience the piece without distraction or with their own personal form of disctraction. 

## What are analog video synthesizer?
Tracking the evolution of my work has been the continual goal because each piece of part of me on a conscious and subcosncious level. Utilizing the data I've pooled, I can create systems that can help w

has provided a large data set I can use to promote myself, but more importantly use as a new artist tool. Understanding that each video is apart of myself, I've also been fascinated by the idea of using the video content data as a way to better understand psychological trends, conscious and subconscious.
