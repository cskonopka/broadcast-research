The *broadcast-research* a data art project that explores the potential using my analog video synthesis catalog as a generative feedback tool for creating artistic works. Written in Go, the project seeks to use data-mining, machine learning and NLP to gain new insights about the catalog and learn about interlaced subconscious psychological trends. 

A detailed overview of the project can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/cskonopka/broadcast-research/wiki).

## Who am I?
My name is Christopher Konopka and I'm a video artist with a focus on modular analog video synthesizers. 

## Project Background
 When I started in 2015, I made the decision to record video content each time I sat down to experiment and whenever I performed. Video art has been and is a significant trend in my life when it comes to interpersonal relationships and personal development. It has provided an outlet that helps encapsulate intense emotions that can derail my focus and enables me to compartimentalize the event. Each piece is a first-hand documentation journal entry that can to provide insight about subconscious trends. Th
 The has provided a unique lens in which I can learn about myself in new ways and this project is meant to extend the potential of new research concepts using video art.
