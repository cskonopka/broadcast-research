The *broadcast-research* a data art project that explores the potential using my analog video synthesis catalog as a generative feedback tool for creating artistic works. Written in Go, the project seeks to use data-mining, machine learning and NLP to gain new insights about the catalog and learn about interlaced subconscious psychological trends. 

A detailed overview of the project can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/cskonopka/broadcast-research/wiki).

## Requirements
* Go
* FFprobe
* FFmpeg
* ImageMagick

## Project Background
When I started using analog video synthesizers in 2015, I actively decided I wanted to record video content each time I sat down for a studio session or live performance. Each piece is a first-hand documentation entry that provides insight about subconscious trends and conscious trends. Documenting daily experiences evolve into a library of emotions that extend the potential of video art as a psychological research topic.

## Who am I?
My name is Christopher Konopka and I'm a video artist with a focus on modular analog video synthesizers. 

## Artist Statement
Christopher Konopka specializes in painting one-of-a-kind visual textures with analog video synthesizers. Evolving organically, each design is an encapsulated moment of experience used to terraform new planes of understanding. Humans store the experience of time in their own unique format by generating a memory and compiling all the internal and external senses. During the archival process of creating new memories, there is a significant amount of discarded nuance. These free-floating threads of minutia hold the potential choice of mindfully engaging unaltered emotional abstractions through creating personal coincidental attachment.
