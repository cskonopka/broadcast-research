The *broadcast-research* a data art project that explores the potential using my analog video synthesis catalog as a generative feedback tool for creating artistic works. Written in Go, the project seeks to use data-mining, machine learning and NLP to gain new insights about the catalog and learn about interlaced subconscious psychological trends. 

A detailed overview of the project can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/cskonopka/broadcast-research/wiki).
